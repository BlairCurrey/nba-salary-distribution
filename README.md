# nba-salary-distribution

I explore the distrubution of salaries on NBA teams over time and in relation to wins. `data-retrieval.ipynb` handles collecting and saving all the data used in `analysis.ipynb`.

`data/raw/soups.zip` is provided as an alternative to rescraping and saving all the html files required for collecting the salary data.
